A person moves ahead by alternately placing one foot in front of the other.
A person moves in reverse by stepping one foot behind the other.
The body rotates forward over the head and shoulders, rolling along the back to return to a sitting or standing position.
A sequence of acrobatic movements, such as flips and rolls, performed in quick succession.
The person bends their knees and lowers their body into a squatting position, keeping the feet flat on the floor.
The player tosses the ball into the air and strikes it with a racquet to begin a point.
The person moves from a standing or sitting position to rest flat on their back or stomach.
A quick, straight punch is thrown with the lead hand toward the opponent.
Lying on a bench, the person pushes a weight upward from chest level and then lowers it back down.
The person ascends by repeatedly lifting each foot onto a higher step.
The person moves along the ground using both hands and knees.
The weight shifts onto one leg as the opposite leg lifts at the hip and knee, swinging forward and making contact with the ground heel-first. The supporting leg pushes off with the toes, extending at the hip, knee, and ankle, while the arms swing alternately in opposition to the legs. The sequence repeats as the body moves rhythmically, maintaining balance through coordinated motion of the trunk, pelvis, and limbs.
The legs alternately extend and flex at the hips and knees, with the feet lifting and moving rearward to make contact with the ground heel-first. The arms swing gently in opposition to the legs, while the trunk remains upright and the head faces forward, maintaining balance throughout the sequence. The center of mass subtly shifts backward as each step is initiated and completed.
The body bends at the hips and knees as both arms extend forward and downward, palms facing the ground. The head tucks toward the chest as the spine rounds; the body shifts weight onto the shoulders, rolling along the upper back while the hips lift and legs push off the floor. The knees remain bent and the arms guide the motion until the feet return to the ground, with the body uncurling and returning upright.
The individual bends the knees and lowers the body, then places the hands on the ground while tucking the chin and rounding the back. Pushing off with the legs, the body rolls forward along the shoulders and back, with the spine flexing and the hips remaining elevated, before extending the legs to return to an upright posture.
The knees and hips flex simultaneously, lowering the pelvis toward the ground while maintaining an upright torso. The ankles dorsiflex as the center of mass shifts downward, and the arms may extend slightly forward or remain at the sides for balance. The spine stays neutral as the body descends in a controlled manner.
The body shifts weight onto the rear leg while the knees bend and the torso rotates backward. One arm lifts upward, fully extending at the shoulder and elbow, while the other arm drops and bends at the elbow behind the back. The body rapidly extends the knees and hips, torso rotates forward, and the raised arm swings overhead in an arcing motion, snapping the wrist and elbow before returning to a balanced stance.
The knees and hips flex as the torso tilts backward, lowering the upper body toward the ground. The elbows bend and shoulders rotate to guide the arms alongside the body or toward the surface for support. Once the back and head make contact, the joints extend and relax, bringing the body to a resting, supine posture.
From a balanced stance, the torso slightly rotates and the weight shifts forward as one arm rapidly extends straight ahead at shoulder height, with the elbow unbending and the fist turning so the palm faces downward. The lead shoulder lifts and the rear heel pivots off the ground, while the opposite arm remains bent and close to the torso for balance. After full extension, the arm quickly retracts along the same path, returning the body to the initial position.
Lying supine with elbows bent and upper arms angled slightly outward from the torso, both arms extend vertically by straightening the elbows while stabilizing the shoulders against a fixed surface. After reaching near full extension, the elbows bend to lower the forearms and hands back toward the chest, repeating the upward and downward arm motion. The feet remain flat, and the lower back maintains slight arch as the upper body stays stable throughout the movement.
One leg bends at the knee and hip, lifting the foot upward and forward while the opposite leg remains extended to provide support. The supporting leg then extends at the knee and ankle to raise the body as the lifted foot makes contact, shifting weight onto the new stance leg. Arms swing naturally in opposition to the legs for balance, and the sequence repeats with the other leg.
The individual alternately bends elbows and knees, supporting their weight on hands and knees while maintaining a low posture. The arms reach forward one at a time as the opposite knee advances, followed by pulling the body forward by extending the elbows and hips. The spine remains flexed, and the head stays raised for orientation as this coordinated, diagonal limb movement repeats.
